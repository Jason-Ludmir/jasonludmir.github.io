## Research Focus

My research focuses on advancing quantum computing systems, particularly in:
- Optimizing compilation techniques for Rydberg atom quantum computers
- Developing hybrid quantum–classical algorithms
- Improving hardware efficiency in neutral atom quantum systems
- Creating quantum machine learning frameworks
- Designing reinforcement learning–based dynamical decoupling sequences for NV center quantum sensors
- Generating entanglement‑rich quantum datasets for quantum machine learning
