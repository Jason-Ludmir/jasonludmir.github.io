### Current Research Projects

I am currently leading several research initiatives:

1. **Quantum Data Generation Framework**  
   Developing a framework to advance entanglement-rich datasets in quantum machine learning.

2. **Quantum Anomaly Detection**  
   Creating an unsupervised, zero-training quantum anomaly detection framework that leverages quantum autoencoders.

3. **Neutral Atom Performance Enhancement**  
   Developing techniques to reduce qubit ejection rates during measurement in neutral atom systems, significantly improving quantum computer performance.

4. **Quantum Circuit Fidelity Optimization**  
   Contributing to research on minimizing output fidelity variability in quantum circuits, addressing both temporal and spatial variability in quantum cloud computing environments.
