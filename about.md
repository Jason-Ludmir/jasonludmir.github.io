I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Rice University, working at the intersection of quantum computing and high‑performance computing under the guidance of Dr. Tirthak Patel. My work spans optimized compilation for Rydberg‑atom systems, hybrid quantum–classical algorithms, and machine‑learning–driven quantum frameworks.

Prior to Rice, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Brown University (focus: database systems and optimization) and hold a B.S. in Finance from Wake Forest University.

## Current Research

My current projects include:
- A compiler for neutral‑atom quantum computers under tight hardware constraints  
- Unsupervised quantum anomaly detection using zero‑training quantum autoencoders  
- Developing quantum data‑generation frameworks to produce entanglement‑rich datasets for QML  
- Designing reinforcement learning–based adaptive dynamical decoupling sequences for NV center quantum sensors

## Recent Recognition

I’m honored to have received:
- **Best Lightning Talk**, Energy HPC Conference (April 2025)  
- **1st Place**, ACM Student Research Competition at SC 2024  
- **Selection**, Inaugural HPC Student Cohort (HPCSC)  
- **DAC Young Fellow** & **Creative Research Dissemination Award** (2024)  
- **Honorable Mention**, ICCAD Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery Challenge (2023)

## Beyond Research

I’m passionate about teaching and mentorship. I’ve served as a TA at Rice and Brown, guided undergraduates on quantum computing projects, and contribute as a conference volunteer and peer reviewer.
