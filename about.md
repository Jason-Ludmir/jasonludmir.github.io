I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Rice University, working at the intersection of quantum computing and high-performance computing under the guidance of Dr. Tirthak Patel. My research focuses on advancing quantum computing through optimized compilation techniques, particularly for Rydberg atom quantum computers, and developing hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

Prior to Rice, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Brown University, where I focused on database systems and optimization under Dr. Stanley Zdonik. I also hold a B.S. in Finance from Wake Forest University, where I specialized in International Business with a minor in Japanese Language.

## Current Research

My current work centers on several key areas:
- Developing optimized compilation techniques for Rydberg atom quantum computers, with a focus on hardware utilization
- Creating hybrid algorithms combining machine learning and quantum computing for problems like anomaly detection
- Leading the development of PARALLAX, a compiler for neutral atom quantum computers
- Contributing to the advancement of quantum generative models and quantum machine learning

## Recent Recognition

I'm honored to have received several recent accolades, including:
- 1st Place in the ACM Student Research Competition at the Supercomputing Conference (2024)
- Selection for the Inaugural HPC Student Cohort
- DAC Young Fellow and Creative Research Dissemination Award (2024)
- Honorable Mention in the ICCAD Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery Challenge (2023)

## Beyond Research

I'm passionate about education and mentorship in quantum computing and computer science. I currently serve as a Teaching Assistant at Rice University and mentor students in quantum computing applications. I also contribute to the academic community through conference volunteering and peer review activities.
